   - Forex/currency exchange for travelers?
   - Travel expense management platform?  
   - International payment solution?

2. **Launch scope?**
   - Geographic markets (US only? International?)
   - User segments (business travelers? consumers? both?)
   - Feature completeness (MVP vs full platform?)

3. **Success metrics?**
   - User signups target for week 1?
   - Transaction volume goals?
   - Revenue targets?

4. **Your role specifics?**
   - What aspects need your direct oversight vs team execution?

   - Communication responsibilities (internal/external)?

5. **Competitive landscape?**
   - Key differentiators to emphasize?
