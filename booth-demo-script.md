## Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**[Booth attendee approaches]**

**Demo Person:** "Hey there! Ever tried to split a bill with friends using different cryptocurrencies? It's a nightmare, right? What if I told you we've solved that problem completely?"

**[Gesture to screen showing CoinFello interface]**

"I'm [Name] from CoinFello. We're launching the first truly multi-chain bill splitting app. Let me show you something that'll blow your mind."

## Core Demo Flow (90 seconds)

### Setup the Scenario (20 seconds)
**Demo Person:** "Picture this: You're at dinner with 3 friends. The bill is $200. One friend only has Bitcoin, another has ETH, you've got Polygon tokens, and your fourth friend prefers to pay in dollars through their bank."

**[Open CoinFello app on tablet/phone]**

"Traditionally, this means awkward calculations, multiple payment apps, and someone getting stuck covering the difference. Watch this..."

### The Magic Moment (45 seconds)
**[Create new bill in app]**

**Demo Person:** "I create a bill for $200, add our four friends..." 

**[Adding participants to bill]**

"Now here's where it gets interesting. Each person can pay in whatever currency they want."

**[Show currency selection: BTC, ETH, MATIC, USD]**

"Person 1 chooses Bitcoin, Person 2 chooses ETH, Person 3 chooses Polygon, Person 4 chooses USD. CoinFello automatically calculates real-time conversion rates and splits everything perfectly."

**[Show the calculated splits with live rates]**

"Look at this - $50 each, but Bitcoin friend pays 0.0012 BTC, ETH friend pays 0.015 ETH, Polygon friend pays 45 MATIC, and USD friend pays exactly $50 to your bank account."

### The Settlement (25 seconds)
**Demo Person:** "Now watch the settlement..."

**[Trigger payment process]**

"Everyone pays in their preferred currency, CoinFello handles all the conversions behind the scenes, and boom - everyone's settled in under 30 seconds."

**[Show completion screen with checkmarks]**

"No more IOUs. No more 'I'll Venmo you later.' No more calculator math. Just fair, instant, multi-chain settlements."

## Value Props & Close (60 seconds)

### Why It Matters (30 seconds)
**Demo Person:** "This isn't just convenient - it's revolutionary. We're solving real problems:

- **Gas efficiency**: Smart routing finds the cheapest paths across chains
- **Fair exchange**: Live rates mean no one gets screwed by outdated conversions  
- **Universal access**: Your non-crypto friends can still participate with traditional payments
- **Trust layer**: Everything's on-chain and verifiable"

### The Opportunity (30 seconds)
**Demo Person:** "We're launching this month, and we're already seeing massive traction. The DeFi space needs this - every restaurant, every shared Uber, every group vacation."

**[Hand them a card/QR code]**

"Want early access? Scan this QR code to join our beta. And if you're a developer interested in our APIs, we're also building the infrastructure layer other apps can plug into."

**[Pause for engagement]**

"Any questions about how the settlement works? Or want to see it in action with real wallets?"
