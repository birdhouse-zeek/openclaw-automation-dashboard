## BuffiBot + T.J. Miller Roast (~2 minutes)

---

### SETUP
**Stage:** Main stage with large screen showing BuffiBot interface
**Props:** Microphone for presenter, BuffiBot responses displayed on screen
**Timing:** 2 minutes total

---

## OPENING (20 seconds)

**Presenter:** "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to EthDenver 2025! I'm here with my co-host, BuffiBot - the AI that thinks it knows more about crypto than you do. BuffiBot, say hello!"

**BuffiBot (on screen):** *"Hello EthDenver! Ready to lose some money... I mean, have some fun building the future!"*

**Presenter:** "And since we couldn't afford a real celebrity host, we've got BuffiBot doing its best T.J. Miller impression. Go ahead, BuffiBot - hit us with your opening bit."

---

## THE ROAST BEGINS (60 seconds)

**BuffiBot:** *"Thanks! You know, T.J. Miller once said he was going to revolutionize cryptocurrency... then he got arrested for fake bomb threats at airports. Guess that's one way to make your portfolio explode!"*

**[Pause for laughs]**

**BuffiBot:** *"But seriously, T.J.'s comedy career has more ups and downs than Bitcoin in 2022. At least when Bitcoin crashes, it doesn't take down an entire HBO show with it!"*

**Presenter:** "Ouch! Tell us what you really think, BuffiBot."

**BuffiBot:** *"Look, T.J. Miller tried to make NFTs of his stand-up routines. The floor price? Zero ETH. Even his jokes are going through a bear market!"*

**[Screen shows fake "T.J. Miller NFT Collection - FLOOR: 0 ETH"]**

**BuffiBot:** *"But hey, at least T.J. Miller prepared us all for crypto volatility - his career taught us that what goes up... can really, REALLY come down fast!"*

---

## TRANSITION TO EVENT (40 seconds)

**Presenter:** "Alright BuffiBot, enough roasting T.J. Miller - let's talk about why we're REALLY here!"

**BuffiBot:** *"Right! Unlike T.J.'s career, EthDenver just keeps getting better every year! This is the one conference where 'HODL' actually means 'Hold On to Da Learning!'"*

**Presenter:** "What should people expect this weekend?"

**BuffiBot:** *"Amazing speakers, groundbreaking demos, and network effects that actually matter - not like T.J.'s networking which mostly consisted of burning bridges! Plus, the food truck lines will move faster than his last movie at the box office."*

**Presenter:** "And speaking of demos..."

**BuffiBot:** *"That's right! Make sure to visit the CoinFello booth and see what REAL innovation looks like. Multi-chain bill splitting that actually works - unlike T.J. Miller's attempt at splitting his career between comedy and... well, whatever that was!"*

---

## CLOSING (20 seconds)

**Presenter:** "BuffiBot, any final words for our EthDenver builders?"

**BuffiBot:** *"Build something amazing, ship something meaningful, and remember - in the immortal words of T.J. Miller: 'I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.' Replace 'love' with 'DeFi' and you've got the EthDenver motto!"*

**Presenter:** "Ladies and gentlemen, let's build the future! EthDenver 2025 is officially open!"
