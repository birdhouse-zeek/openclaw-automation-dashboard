## 🔄 THE TWO-FLOW EXPERIENCE

### FLOW A: BuffiBot Introduction (Trust Earning)
**Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Purpose:** Utility + delight, no hard selling

**Staff opener:** "Hey! Want to meet BuffiBot? They're your conference sidekick."

**BuffiBot interaction examples:**
```
"What's the best session happening right now?"
"Where can I grab decent coffee that's not a 20-minute line?"
"I'm looking for teams working on infrastructure - who should I meet?"
"What's happening tonight that's not just another networking mixer?"
```

**BuffiBot responses showcase:**
- Real-time conference data
- Personality (helpful + playful)
- Actual utility (not just chatbot responses)

**Transition moment:** If visitor engages twice OR asks "what else can you do?"

### FLOW B: CoinFello Demo (Proof of Execution)
**Duration:** Under 60 seconds
**Purpose:** Demonstrate real on-chain capability

**The handoff line:** *"If you want to go beyond the conference - I can do this on your wallet too."*

**Demo options (pick ONE per visitor):**

#### Option 1: Simple Swap
```
Visitor intent: "I want to swap some ETH for USDC"
CoinFello response:
→ "I found the best route" [shows DEX comparison]
→ "I'll execute it" [shows clear transaction preview] 
→ "It's live on-chain" [shows confirmation]
```

#### Option 2: Recurring Swap (RECOMMENDED - already live)
```
Visitor intent: "I want to DCA into ETH weekly"
CoinFellow response:
→ "I found the optimal strategy" [shows recurring setup]
→ "I'll execute the first one" [shows transaction preview]
→ "It's live and automated" [shows confirmation + schedule]
```

#### Option 3: Simple Yield
```
Visitor intent: "I want to earn yield on my USDC"
CoinFellow response:
→ "I found safe options" [shows yield comparison]
