## 🎭 OPENING (30 seconds)

**T.J. Miller:** "Alright ETHDenver, let's meet your conference guide. Everyone, say hello to BuffiBot!"

**BuffiBot:** "Hey builders! I'm BuffiBot - your sidekick for the next five days. Think of me as your conference native who never gets tired, never gets lost, and definitely knows where the best coffee is."

**T.J.:** "BuffiBot, what should I know about ETHDenver this year?"

**BuffiBot:** "2,500 builders, 300 projects, 47 side events, and exactly one place that serves decent burritos at 2 AM. Want me to bookmark that for you?"

**BuffiBot:** "T.J., want to set up a recurring buy for your favorite meme coin while you're here?"

**T.J.:** "Uh, sure? Make it happen."

**BuffiBot:** 
- *"I found the best route"* [shows DEX comparison]
- *"I'll execute it"* [shows transaction preview] 
- *"It's live on-chain"* [shows confirmation]

**T.J.:** "Wait, that actually worked? No wallet fumbling, no gas fee confusion, no 'transaction failed' anxiety?"

**BuffiBot:** "Exactly. I handle the complexity. You focus on building."

## 🚀 THE HANDOFF (30 seconds)

**BuffiBot:** "This week, I'm your conference buddy. But if you want this power beyond ETHDenver..."

**T.J.:** "Let me guess - CoinFello?"

**BuffiBot:** "CoinFello is the engine behind me. Same safe execution, but for your real wallet, real strategies, real DeFi life."

**T.J.:** "So BuffiBot gets me through the week..."

**BuffiBot:** "And CoinFello gets you through everything else."

## 🎪 CLOSING (15 seconds)

**T.J.:** "Builders, meet BuffiBot in the ETHDenver app. And when you're ready to level up..."

**T.J.:** "ETHDenver 2026 - let's build!"
